# üöÄ Building PathTracker Without Local Keystore

If you can't create a keystore locally, you have several options to still build your APK!

## ‚ö° **Quick Option: Use GitHub Actions Keystore Creator**

### Step 1: Upload Your Project to GitHub
```bash
cd /home/sbn/Documents/kml/PathTracker
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial PathTracker Android app"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PathTracker.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Create Keystore via GitHub Actions
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. Find **üîê Create Keystore for PathTracker** workflow
4. Click **Run workflow**
5. Fill in the form:
   - **Keystore password**: `pathtracker123` (or your choice, min 6 chars)
   - **Key password**: `pathkey123` (or your choice, min 6 chars)
   - **Full name**: `Your Name`
   - **Organization**: `PathTracker`
   - **City**: `Your City`
   - **State**: `Your State`
   - **Country**: `US` (or your country code)
6. Click **Run workflow**

### Step 3: Get Your Secrets
1. After the workflow completes, click on it
2. Check the **logs** - they'll show you the 4 secrets to copy
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
4. Add these 4 secrets:
   - `SIGNING_KEY`
   - `ALIAS`
   - `KEY_STORE_PASSWORD`
   - `KEY_PASSWORD`

### Step 4: Build Your APK
1. Go to **Actions** ‚Üí **üö∂ Build PathTracker APK**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Wait for completion
4. Download the APK from **Artifacts**

## üîß **Alternative: Unsigned APK (For Testing Only)**

If you just want to test the app quickly, I can modify the workflow to skip signing:

### Modified Build Workflow (Unsigned)
```yaml
# Remove the signing step entirely
# APK will be unsigned but still installable for testing
```

This creates an unsigned APK that you can install for testing, but won't be suitable for distribution.

## üåê **Online Keystore Generators**

You can also use online tools to generate a keystore:

1. **Android Developer Console**:
   - Has built-in keystore generation
   - Secure and official

2. **Local Java Installation**:
   - Download OpenJDK from [adoptopenjdk.net](https://adoptopenjdk.net)
   - Install locally
   - Use `keytool` command

## üéØ **Recommended Path**

**For production apps**: Use the GitHub Actions keystore creator above - it's secure and automated.

**For quick testing**: Let me know if you want me to create an unsigned build workflow.

**For learning**: Try installing Java locally when you have admin access.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Notes**

- **Never share your keystore passwords**
- **Keep your keystore file safe** - you'll need it for app updates
- **Use strong passwords** (at least 8 characters with mixed case/numbers)
- **Don't commit keystore files to your repository**

## üöÄ **Ready to Proceed?**

Choose your preferred method and let's get your PathTracker APK built! The GitHub Actions approach is the most beginner-friendly since it handles all the Java/Android SDK setup automatically.
