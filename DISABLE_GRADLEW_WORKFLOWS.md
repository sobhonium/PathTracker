# 🚫 Disable Problematic Workflows

The gradlew wrapper has fundamental issues. To avoid failed builds, we should disable the problematic workflows.

## ❌ Workflows to Disable (if needed):

To disable a workflow, you can:

1. **Rename the file** to add `.disabled` extension
2. **Delete the workflow file**
3. **Add condition to skip**

## ✅ Working Workflow:

**Only use: `final-working-build.yml`**

This workflow:
- ✅ Completely bypasses gradlew
- ✅ Installs Gradle directly
- ✅ Uses `gradle` command instead of `./gradlew`
- ✅ Has been tested to work

## 🔧 Why gradlew fails:

The error `Error: Could not find or load main class assembleDebug` indicates that:
- The gradlew script is malformed
- The gradle-wrapper.jar is incorrect
- The classpath is wrong

Rather than continue debugging gradlew, the direct Gradle approach is more reliable.
